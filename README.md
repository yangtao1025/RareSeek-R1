# RareSeek-R1

**RareSeek-R1** is a domain-specialized large language model for rare-disease diagnostic reasoning, developed through a Progressive Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning framework. The model is first instruction-tuned on the clinically grounded RareMed-Corpus, a large, multi-source dataset deeply integrated from medical textbooks, guidelines, biomedical literature, and real-world EHR narratives. It is then fine-tuned on RareMed-CoT, a high-fidelity corpus designed to instill explicit, stepwise clinical reasoning aligned with real diagnostic workflows.
